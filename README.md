Generating Random Numbers That Don't Repeat

This project is an example of a random number generator that can be used to generate random numbers from a predefined list
of numbers so that no number generated repeats per instance of that number in the predefined list.  Example: this can be used
to generate 10 numbers that are in the range 50-100 which are unique.  It can also be used to generate numbers from a list
containing any integers.  Useful in applications where successive random numbers need to be generated that exclude certain values.
